## Changelog

Public release update.
Download available [**here**](https://github.com/Phoenixx19/JumpKingPlus/releases/tag/v1.5.0). <!-- more -->

### Features added:
Mods:
- Added functionalities for custom NPCs (textures, speeches and deals) for future uses
    - NPC triggers a quote if player is wearing an item. (thanks to Abaddon!)
    - NPC triggers a quote if player has fallen more than given amount of times. (thanks to Abaddon!)
    
    Check out in the [**documentation**](https://phoenixx19.github.io/JumpKingPlus/workshop/documentation/#npcs) how to implement it.
- Upgraded **JumpKingRPC**'s functionalities
    - Default locations are now located inside an XML file (`Content/settings/discordLocations.xml`) instead of hard-coded junk. <br>_Do not edit this unless you know what you are doing!_
    - Added support for custom level images.

Tweaks:
- Added __Quick Version Control__; by pressing `Left Shift` + `V`, a small text popups in-game displaying the latest version.
- Added the __Look Above / Look Below__ feature that lets you see the screen above by pressing `Z` or the screen below by pressing `X` (suggested by IntroCar!)
- Added __Game Progress__ percentage toggle; displays the babe percentage to the top (below the classic timer).
- Added a **Quickload** setting in the `JumpKing.exe.Config` file that makes Jump King starting time **super fast**! *(enabled by default)*

Fixes:
- Removed multiple unused methods from previous versions to lighten up the total dll size.

### After release fixes:
This fixes can be found on the `JKPlusInstaller-v1.5.0-x86.msi` on the [__release page__](https://github.com/Phoenixx19/JumpKingPlus/releases/tag/v1.5.0):
- Fixed an issue causing the installer to not get rid of previous Vanilla Jump King `ControllerBinds` files. *(finally)*
- Fixed an issue causing the game to crash on start for missing `settings` files.
