New custom levels for JumpKingPlus are just around the corner and what a good way to help the level designer/creators by having a dedicated page for your level!

<!-- more -->

As said, the level designer now have a dedicated page for their creation so they can show a teaser trailer, countless images and much more details on the lore or on the level itself!

> "Invisible mode" by Tetoloid; thanks for your kind help on putting up some images!

A new page has been added to the sidemenu of the workshop. The ***publish page*** can help you through to add your map on the site by compiling a simple form!

The third UI update also fixes small details on documentation, reorders the most Frequently Asked Question in the usage order.
