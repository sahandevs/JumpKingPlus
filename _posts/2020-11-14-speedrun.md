## Hi fellow jumpers, good news! ‚è≥üèÜ

JumpKingPlus has been **approved** for speedrunning on speedrun.com! In order to get your run valid onto the website you will need to **disable** the "cheats" if you have them enabled. <!-- more --> You can check how to enable/disable them in the new section called [**qna**](https://phoenixx19.github.io/JumpKingPlus/qna) (or Questions and Answers) for some common issues users recently had installing and using JumpKingPlus!
