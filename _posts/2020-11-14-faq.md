#### _Are the maps unbalanced?_
> In order to get released on the site, the map has to be **checked** by **numerous play testers** for **unfair platforms** and **visibility issues**.<br><br>The most refined map has been in the works for over six months and is the one that is scheduled to be released in Early August, 2021 as shown in the July 25th teaser trailer. This map alone has new features in relation to jumping that *could* surprise you. The map rivals the original Nexile's style that will make you feel like you're playing Jump King for the first time again.

#### _JumpKing crashes after pressing a key. Fix?_
> Delete your controller binds (they are .xml files, look the image below for an example) inside the `ControllerBinds` folder inside `Jump King\Content`.

> Say goodbye to your binds though.

#### _Is it fine for speedrunning?_
> ![tools](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Phoenixx19/JumpKingPlus/www/images/tools.png)
JumpKingPlus has been [**approved**](https://phoenixx19.github.io/JumpKingPlus/speedrun) on speedrun(dot)com for speedrunning. You will need to disable cheats (if you have them enabled, **cheats enabled runs will be not valid**). More details on the speedrun rules here: https://www.speedrun.com/jumpking

#### How do I install a custom level?

> 1. Find a level you would like to play in the workshop section, download it using the Download button.
> 2. Unzip the .zip file.
> 3. Open JKPlusModManager, select your **Jump King folder** and click on **Select new mod**.
> 4. Select your new `mods` folder and click **Load**.
> 5. Profit.

> If you are **not** using JKPlusModManager:
> 1. Find a level you would like to play in the workshop section, download it using the Download button.
> 2. Open the .zip file.
> 3. Replace the `Jump King/Content/mods` folder with the `mods` folder inside the .zip file.
> 4. (optional) Make sure the level.xnb and mod.xml file exist.
> 5. Open Jump King and click on New Game (unless you have a save for it).
> 6. Profit.

#### How do I uninstall a custom level?
>It's even more simple.<br>Click **Unload** inside the [JKPlusModManager](https://github.com/Phoenixx19/JumpKingPlus/releases/download/v1.2.0/JKPlusModManager-v0.1.0.exe) application.<br>Or just delete the `mods` folder or what's inside of it.

#### I have updated Jump King and now JumpKingPlus is gone.
>Uninstall JumpKingPlus and reinstall it. Don't worry if when opening Jump King it's doing some updates... it should not change the files anyway.

#### _Can't uninstall JumpKingPlus..._
>Reinstall JumpKing and try uninstall after downloading it again.

__"Still not working :("__
>Send me a message through Jump King's Discord or Github and I'll try to help you through.

#### _I don't like the binds? Can I change them?_
>![Bind](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Phoenixx19/JumpKingPlus/www/images/bind.png)
Sure, they are fully bindable on all devices (as long as you plug them in).
The previous binds before installing JumpKingPlus **won't work** so please politely rebind your preferred controller.

#### _How do you toggle/untoggle the tools or "cheats"?_
>Edit the `JumpKing.exe.config` file inside the Jump King folder; where it says `cheats="False"` change it to `cheats="True"` if you want to toggle "cheats".

#### _Can I customize JumpKingPlus?_
>Yes, I left the source code on Github and you can easily recompile the `JumpKingPlus.dll` file if you would like.
