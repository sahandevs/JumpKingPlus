Do you think you know Jump King very well as much as your eyes closed? Then this is for you; all you can see is yourself, the props and the NPCs.

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This map is all covered in darkness except NPCs and items.<br>
    It may seem difficult at first glance, but it's a level of difficulty that anyone doing speedruns can do.<br>
    If you are confident in Jump King, why not give it a try?</p>
    <p>Attention: NB+ and GB can be played but the game crashes after touching Babe, intended since custom game allow one babe only.</p>
