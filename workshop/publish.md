## Publishing guidelines

Level design in Jump King is a delicate balance between fairness and hardness. These rules are not only made to prevent unfair and impossible levels but to respect Nexile's original ideas on mapping. Also in order to get your map approved on the site, these rules **need** to be followed.

<div class="intro" style="padding: 1.6em;">
    <ol>
        <li><b>Screen transitions must be full jumps</b>; it would be unfair for a player not knowing how to jump over a new screen</li>
        <li><b>Transition platforms should always work</b> (with a full jump) and they <b>must not be related to a specific position</b> in the platform before the transition to the new screen</li>
        <li><b>Platforms must be bordered with a line</b> (with at least 1px)</li>
        <li>Do not exaggerate with the Lost Frontier jumps (8px platform equals to 1px in the hitboxes file. No one likes 1px jumps, especially if there are one after another!</li>
    </ol>
</div>

### Advice
Here are some rules and tips that you can pick to make a great level. You don't necessarily need to follow any of these below.

#### Level design rules (hitboxes)

- Write down your locations before starting with the level design; this will help you through the level design

- Make your platforms easy to navigate

- Don't exaggerate with the teleport blocks and make sure you can fall all way to the start of your level (unless you want checkpoints)

- Don't create a level which focuses only on one mechanic of the game

- Testing is a very important part, so don't forget to ask for an helping hand when it comes to testing

#### Art design rules (screens, props, music, etc)

- Create your level as detailed and unique as possible

- Make sure your art design is made in the native Jump King resolution (480px x 360px)

- Make it as immersive as possible using music, SFX (Sound Effects), background to your advantage

- Try to create your own props, compositions instead of using the originals from Jump King

- Make sure that you have a good segue between locations in the screens (background, midground)

## Next step

To get it published on the site, fill in the following Google Form where it will get verified by one the level publisher testers.

The .zip file should contain your mods folder and only the files needed for the level custom. Please host the level yourself, the JumpKingPlus' GitHub repository does not work as a cloud!
