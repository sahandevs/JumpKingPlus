# Jump King Manager
{: .fs-9 }

is a helpful tool to practice Jump King, but lets you load/save positions and teleport to any screen; made by [**DevilSquirrel**](https://github.com/ShootMe).
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

> Warning!
    <br>**Jump King Manager** works on the game's memory and it has a tendency to crash the game if teleporting is overused.

## Usage

1. Open the executable.
2. Make sure you have opened Jump King.
3. Click on a location to teleport in.
4. If you need to be more specific, you can open the select box and click "*Go*" once chosen a specific screen.
5. If you want, you can save the position by click "*Save Position*". If you ever wanted to go back to that point, click "*Load Position*".
6. Done!
