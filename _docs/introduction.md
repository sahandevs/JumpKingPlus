## Custom levels
### Disclaimer
When it comes to Custom levels, folders that this document refer to are meant to be inside `Jump King/Content/mods`. 

### Common rules
Level design in Jump King is a delicate balance between fairness and hardness. These rules are not only made to prevent unfair and impossible levels but to respect Nexile's original ideas on level design. Also in order to get your map approved on the site, these rules **need** to be followed.

<div class="intro" style="padding: 1.6em;">
    <ol>
        <li><b>Screen transitions must be full jumps</b>; it would be unfair for a player not knowing how to jump over a new screen</li>
        <li><b>Transition platforms should always work</b> (with a full jump) and they <b>must not be related to a specific position</b> in the platform before the transition to the new screen</li>
        <li><b>Platforms must be bordered with a line</b> (with at least 1px)</li>
        <li>Do not exaggerate with the Lost Frontier jumps (8px platform equals to 1px in the hitboxes file. No one likes 1px jumps, especially if there are one after another!</li>
    </ol>
</div>

## Reskins/collections
### Disclaimer
If you are working on a Jump King Base reskin, enabling and disabling it will work only in the title screen (currently) and they won't be working on custom maps since it would overlay the already existing base for the custom map.

### Common rules
Rules on reskins/collections are a bit more "leanient" than custom levels since it doesn't have such a big impact.

<div class="intro" style="padding: 1.6em;">
    <ol>
        <li>Not NSFW or explicit content</li>
        <li>Your skin/collection should be distinguishable from the base item</li>
        <li>No reposts</li>
    </ol>
</div>

### Reskin or collection?
Before getting started you need to know the difference between a reskin and a collection.

- A **reskin** is a *single custom skin* that can be toggled singularly in the `Reskins` menu.
- A **collection** is a *group of skins* that can be toggled together in the `Collections` menu.
