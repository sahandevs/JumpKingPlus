# King folder

contains the textures of the wearable items by the player in the custom level.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

By changing these, you will have a different texture for the item only when the custom mode is triggered.<br>
**Keep the same item name** in order to get it working.

## Wardrobe update disclaimer
Since the `king` folder also has the base.xnb file which contains the babe, the following reskins and collections won't work in custom levels:
- Base reskin
- Collection that contains a base skin
